The job interview marathon continues, and consequently this will be a short one. But I feel that I omitted a critical, seemingly obvious piece of information in [my previous post][1]:

**Technical interviewing is a skill like any other, and it is built with practice.** It is a mistake, at least for me, to assume that since I can build awesome stuff I therefore *must* possess good technical interviewee skills. In my experience, the two skills seem almost orthogonal. Here's how I've been building my technical interview chops:

*   **Develop a system.** I found this [post about breaking down interview questions][2] to be quite helpful.
*   **Drill, drill, drill.** The previous link mentions [Topcoder][3] as a good source of practice material. I actually prefer the [Dailyprogrammer subreddit][4]. The comments tend to be highly educational, with solutions in a variety of languages.
*   **Warm up just before the interview.** Lately I've been doing a problem or two on Dailyprogrammer just prior to the interview. Typically, I'll choose an intermediate or easy problem, just to build confidence.
